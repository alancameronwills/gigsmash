      "text": "TogetherAndy Irvine &amp; Quilty offer a unique musical journey taking in the cultures of their two native countries, Ireland and Sweden.  Andy Irvine is one of the great Irish singers, his voice one of a handful of truly great ones that gets to the very soul of Ireland. He has been hailed as &quot;a tradition in himself.&quot; Musician, singer and songwriter, Andy has maintained his highly individual performing skills throughout his over 55-year career. From Sweeney's Men in the mid 60s, to the enormous success of Planxty in the 70s, his duo with Paul Brady in the later 70s and then from Patrick Street to Mozaik, LAPD and Usher’s Island, Andy has been a world music pioneer and an icon for traditional music and musicians.  Ever the man for new pastures, Andy has played concerts all over Europe and has toured many times in Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada. He was also undertaken extensive tours of Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua, Japan, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Argentina and Chile.  Although an integral part of the finest Irish bands of our time, Andy Irvine continues along the path he set for himself so long ago - a vibrant career as a solo artist in the old style, a teller of tales and maker of music  The Swedish band Quilty is a renowned interpreter of traditional Irish music and considered being the foremost band of the Irish folkmusic scene in Scandinavia.  In 2020 Quilty was nominated Band of the Year at the national Folk &amp; World Music Gala event.  Since 2020 Quilty has been touring with the program Out on the Ocean - sea shanties, emigration songs, love ballads and songs about epic adventures at sea in a salty and tar scented concert programme combining Irish and Scottish songs with the Atlantic Ocean as a backdrop, as well as the traditional music from their own country - Sweden.",

Due to their rare instrumentation, it has allowed the group to explore a wide range of chamber works that are incredibly unique and as a group aim to put underrepresented works side by side with the “classics” that audiences are typically used to hearing at chamber concerts. The ensembles performances have been noted as being incredibly energetic and full of passion, due to the innovative programmes they put together and the vibrant playing of the members. All coming from very different musical backgrounds, each individual member brings something special to the group while also balancing their own musical commitments outside of the ensemble. Constantly pushing for new works for their instrumentation, they have collaborated with renowned composers including Danny Elfman and Xavier Foley, as well as encourage new and upcoming composers to explore their ideas with the ensemble. The group have various exciting projects ahead including a recital series at Manchester Cathedral, multiple European and World premieres, and a tour of South Wales this May.       - ‘Die Wolfsjungen’ by Danny Elfman  - ‘Memories of Astor’ by Yasunori Kanazawa  - ‘Music from the Truman Show’ by Philip Glass  - ‘Key West’ by Xavier Foley Welsh Premiere   - INTERVAL-  - ‘The Trout Quintet’ by Franz Schubert   ",

      "text": "As multi-disciplinary artists, Samana weaves together their poetry, music, striking photography, and fine art into a single, transformative and immersive experience. Every element of their work is crafted with ritualistic devotion, recorded in their analogue studio, The Road Records, and developed in the darkroom tucked away in the remote hills of Wales.  Their music confronts the most profound aspects of the human condition, embracing both its weight and its transcendence. It invites us to reclaim our time, our essence, and our place within the natural world, urging a journey beyond our limitations. Oscillating between melancholic ballads and spiritual awakenings, Samana’s sound guides listeners through cinematic landscapes, invoking ancient beliefs, revolution, healing, the unseen, and the profound depths of love, loss, and death. Born from a nomadic existence and steeped in solitude, Samana’s work draws heavily from the philosophy of dreams, the subconscious, and the transformative power of improvisation. Each song pulses with ethereal energy and unfiltered emotional honesty, offering a direct passage to the spirit—stripping away illusions and revealing the raw, shamanic force that connects us to the very core of our being. This is music that speaks to the soul, igniting the heart and awakening the inner sanctum of our existence.    watch video    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMBfKF9pzdU  ",

      "text": "The Unwinding    A meditation in music, word and image from Nia Harries and Jackie Morris.    In 2020 a small book was published. The book’s aim was to be a refuge for the troubled soul. Now the book has become a performance by acclaimed cellist Nia Harries, accompanied by the words and images from the book. Described by Maria Popover  of The Marginalia as “An uncommonly enchanted painted poem celebrating the wilderness of the imagination and our capacity for love, trust, and hope.’    The musical  composition for the Unwinding uses the cello to it's full, technically virtuosic with rich expressive harmonies, as well as simple plain melodies drawing on the tradition of Welsh folk songs. There are dramatic changes of texture and mood within the music, closely interwoven with the poetry and stunning art work.     Jackie Morris is an author and illustrator. Her works include The Lost Words and The Lost Spells, co-created with Robert Macfarlane, and The Unwinding, an illustrated book for dreamers, published by Unbound. Her works have been translated into many languages, though as she says, images need no translation. She has illustrated and written over 60 books, and now her work focusses on both peace and protest, in the most beautiful way possible.  ",
